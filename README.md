# IoT-Based-Battery-Monitoring-System-For-Electric-Vehicles
Using - ESP32(Wrover),Thinkspeak,ArdinoIDE&amp;Sensors.

This project aims to develop an IoT-based battery parameter monitoring system for electric vehicles. The system will measure the battery's health, 
temperature, voltage, and current during charging and discharging cycles. The data collected from the sensors will be transmitted wirelessly to a 
cloud-based platform, where it will be processed, analyzed, and displayed in real-time. The system will also include a mobile application to allow
users to view real-time battery parameter data and receive notifications about any abnormalities.
